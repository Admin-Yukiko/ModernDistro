// Drop this in pkg/commands/test and compile it in scite then use .test in game, I have a few of these scripts.
// The only thing to remember about text commands that is very important is well two things actually, they are hierarchical
// which means if you put a test.src file in the commands/player folder and one in commands/admin, the admin one is only usable by admin command level
// and if I remember correctly, if an admin uses .test in game the admin level one will take precedent so it is advised to use unique names for command
// and place them in the command level folder they fit in. Pangaea is riddled with duplicate commands because someone does not understand hierarchical
// structure so there is a mess of duplicate commands spread across multiple folders in some cases, rather annoying. Note that when I say hierarchical,
// if you put this in the counselor folder the player command level will not have access to it, however, counselor, seer, gm, admin and test command level
// characters will.
// command level structure from lowest to highest is: 
// 0 - player
// 1 - counselor
// 2 - seer
// 3 - gm
// 4 - admin
// 5 - test
