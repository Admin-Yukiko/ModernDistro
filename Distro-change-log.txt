I am starting this Distro change log for the Modern Distro. Up until now all changes/fixes have been in the commit notes. However, I think they should be in a change log file as well. Hopefully I will be as diligent in entering changes here as the Core developers are with core-changes.

2018-08-03	Fixed SkillCheck in :attributes:skillCheck.inc. It could possibly return a negative number. Skill scripts test for zero or a value.
			This was returning false positives (passing) on a SkillCheck function call.
2018-08-04	Added buff icon support to timedScripts.
2018-08-04	Added timedScripts to the clumsy spell for initial buff icon test. It works!
2018-08-04	Added timedScripts to the rest of Circle 01 spells.
2018-08-04	Removed stupid references to "little girl's panties" from the :magery:settings.cfg file.
2018-08-04	Added PlyrScrollsReqRegs, PlyrScrollsReqMana, PlyrSpellsReqRegs, PlyrSpellsReqMana settings to :magery:settings.cfg for customization.
2018-08-04	Added support for the new :magery:settings.cfg settings to :magery:spellStarter.src.
2018-08-04	Moved timedScripts pkg from /pkg/mobiles folder to /pkg/utils folder.
2018-08-04	Added my good ol' stanby test script target.src to /pkg/commands/test.
2018-08-06	Fixed missing graphics for garden shed deed.
2018-08-06	Removed location checks for multi housing. I may add them back in at a later date but facet support was needed and right now I did not need the distraction.
2018-08-06	Fixed missing flags in CreateMultiAtLocation function calls in houseDeed.src in :housing:.
2018-08-07	Removed constants for resists. We'll just use damage constants. Makes it easier to import some scripts from 098 Distro.
2018-08-07	Changed the element spellId to spell_Id for the info struct in spellStarter that is sent to the spell scripts.
2018-08-07	Added a 6th parameter, explode := 0, to MS_PlaySpellGFX function is spells.inc.
2018-08-07	Fixed a bug in function MS_PlaySpellGFX in which it was sending targ.realm as the last parameter (explode) to uo.em function PlayMovingEffect.
2018-08-07	Added some missing sound definitions to /scripts/include/sounds.inc.
2018-08-08	Disabled the party packet hook as the Core now handles parties internally. Will remove the packet hook at a later date.
2018-08-08	Added walkOn pkg rom 098 Distro to /pkg/items folder.
2018-08-08	Changed pkg name of food&drink to food_drink. Also changed /pkg/items/food to /pkg/items/food_drink.
2018-08-08	Completed upgrading spell circles 1 through 4. I want to add more cliloc support to them. Teleport and telekinisis needs support for Static Housing added.
2018-08-08	Changed the name of the spell script spellReflect.src to magicReflection.src to match the actual name of the spell in the spellbook.
2018-08-08	Changed the reference to spellReflect to magicReflection in spells.cfg.
2018-08-09	Fixed an error in determining party members in archProtection.src and archCure.src.
2018-08-08	Added a cliloc YsyMessage to fireField.src if caster does not have LOS to targetted location.
2018-08-09	Upgraded mos9t 5, 6, and 7 circle spells to work with the spell casting and timedScripts in the Modern Distro. Some 5, 6, and 7 circle spells are better left as is.
2018-08-09	Removed all references to fire field, parafield, and poison field from the main itemdesc.cfg file in /config.
