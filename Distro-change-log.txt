I am starting this Distro change log for the Modern Distro. Up until now all changes/fixes have been in the commit notes. However, I think they should be in a change log file as well. Hopefully I will be as diligent in entering changes here as the Core developers are with core-changes.

2018-08-03	Fixed SkillCheck in :attributes:skillCheck.inc. It could possibly return a negative number. Skill scripts test for zero or a value.
			This was returning false positives (passing) on a SkillCheck function call.
2018-08-04	Added buff icon support to timedScripts.
2018-08-04	Added timedScripts to the clumsy spell for initial buff icon test. It works!

2018-08-04	Removed stupid references to "little girl's panties" from the :magery:settings.cfg file.
