I am starting this Distro change log for the Modern Distro. Up until now all changes/fixes have been in the commit notes. However, I think they should be in a change log file as well. Hopefully I will be as diligent in entering changes here as the Core developers are with core-changes.

2018-08-03	Fixed SkillCheck in :attributes:skillCheck.inc. It could possibly return a negative number. Skill scripts test for zero or a value.
			This was returning false positives (passing) on a SkillCheck function call.
2018-08-04	Added buff icon support to timedScripts.
2018-08-04	Added timedScripts to the clumsy spell for initial buff icon test. It works!
2018-08-04	Added timedScripts to the rest of Circle 01 spells.
2018-08-04	Removed stupid references to "little girl's panties" from the :magery:settings.cfg file.
2018-08-04	Added PlyrScrollsReqRegs, PlyrScrollsReqMana, PlyrSpellsReqRegs, PlyrSpellsReqMana settings to :magery:settings.cfg for customization.
2018-08-04	Added support for the new :magery:settings.cfg settings to :magery:spellStarter.src.

2018-08-04	Added my good ol' stanby test script target.src to /pkg/commands/test.
2018-08-06	Fixed missing graphics for garden shed deed.
2018-08-06	Removed location checks for multi housing. I may add them back in at a later date but facet support was needed and right now I did not need the distraction.
2018-08-06	Fixed missing flags in CreateMultiAtLocation function calls in houseDeed.src in :housing:.
2018-08-07	Removed constants for resists. We'll just use damage constants. Makes it easier to import some scripts from 098 Distro.
2018-08-07	Changed the element spellId to spell_Id for the info struct in spellStarter that is sent to the spell scripts.
2018-08-07	Added a 6th parameter, explode := 0, to MS_PlaySpellGFX function is spells.inc.
2018-08-07	Fixed a bug in function MS_PlaySpellGFX in which it was sending targ.realm as the last parameter (explode) to uo.em function PlayMovingEffect.
2018-08-07	Added some missing sound definitions to /scripts/include/sounds.inc.
